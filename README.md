👋 Hello! I'm Arijit, a passionate **Full Stack Web Developer** with 1+ years of hands-on experience in creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. 🚀 I'm also a **Software Engineer**, **Front-End Developer**, **Mobile App Developer**, and **AI Enthusiast**.

I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces using modern technologies, with a primary focus on React and Next.js. These frameworks allow me to build seamless applications that enhance user experiences. I also enjoy crafting engaging designs with tools like Figma and leveraging platforms like Webflow and Wix for rapid prototyping.

On the backend, I have a solid foundation in Laravel, enabling me to build robust APIs and manage server-side logic effectively. I’m comfortable working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB for comprehensive data management. Additionally, I have experience customizing WordPress and WooCommerce sites, integrating various APIs and third-party services to enhance functionality.

I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of web development. Whether it's creating interactive web applications, optimizing performance, or collaborating with talented teams, I'm ready to make a meaningful impact.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with your projects!
